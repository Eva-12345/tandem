tandem
======

This is an algorithm for voiced speech separation and pitch tracking in monaural conditions. You will find two versions of this algorithm, a 128-channel version and a 64-channel version, under "tandem_128" and "tandem_64", respectively. 

The 128-version is originally developed by G. Hu in 2006 and then completed by K. Hu in 2012. It implements the algorithm described in “A tandem algorithm for pitch estimation and voiced speech segregation,”  by G. Hu and D. L. Wang in IEEE Trans. Audio, Speech, Lang. Process., vol. 18, pp. 2067-2079, 2010. 

The 64-channel version is implemented by K. Hu for the paper “Unvoiced speech separation from nonspeech interference via CASA and spectral subtraction,” by K. Hu and D. L. Wang in IEEE Trans. Audio, Speech, and Lang. Process., vol. 19, pp. 1600-1609, 2011.
